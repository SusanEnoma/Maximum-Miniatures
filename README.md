# Maximum Miniatures
These are reports from a fictitious Manufacturing company called Maximum Miniatures Inc culled from the book "Delivering Business Intelligence with Microsoft SQL Server 2016. 
I included a some reports from the book alongside my preferred visualisations. The first page focused on the Sales Overview to give a general idea of what the companies' sales looked like, I highlighted the top 5 sales persons, the top leading states as well as the leading customers with respect to sales. I included the KPI to show that they were below their target of $120.56m hence I used color code red. 
The second page revealed New York sales and the products that were responsible for their leading position. The third page compared their sales in the current year versus the previous year, and also looked at their sales in US dollars versus their products and the effect promotions had on their sales.
The final page shows each product in comparison with it's performance from the beginning of the year to date showing a target of $2.24m. Color code green reveals good, yellow is neutral and red is bad.
